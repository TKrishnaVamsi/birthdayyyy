Chanti Bava,
On your birthday today, I just want to tell you something simple from my heart you are my blessing. Life feels safer, lighter, and so much more meaningful because you are in it.
Thank you for the way you care, you listen, the way you stand by me even when I’m difficult to understand. Thank you for loving me in ways I never knew I needed.
I’m proud of the man you are your strength, your kindness, your patience, and your beautiful heart. You deserve every happiness, every success, and every bit of love this world can give.
Happy Birthday, Bava
I pray this year brings you peace, joy, and everything your soul has been waiting for. I love you more than words can ever say.

Hey Dad, Chinnoda here.
happy 48th dadda 
Firstly, I want to thank you for always standing like a pillar for me.
When times were hard, you always proved that when you’re here, nothing’s going to happen to me, and I’m very grateful that God made me a part of this family so I could experience what an amazing father you are. I’m really glad that God chose me for it.
There’s never going to be enough “thank you’s” and “I love you’s” for everything you’ve provided us, everything you’ve given us, and every tear you’ve shed for us.
One day, I promise I’ll make all of them worth it.
Love you very, very much, Dad.  
love,  
kinderjoy

Happy birthday nana 🤍  
Thank you for always being my inspiration and supportive always to me and giving me a wonderful life where I’ll not have any type of troubles…  
I've always felt so lucky to have a dad like you…  
You gave everything to me that I ever asked for and never made me sad.  
One day I’ll return everything and make your name proud with lots of love.
You’re the only person I look forward to every single day even if I don’t speak with you… you’re my priority always ❤️
I’m working hard only for you nana.  
Thank you for being the world’s best dad.
If I’m ever born again, I’ll ask God to make you my dad again ❤️
I’m sorry if I made you sad before. My comeback is only for you.
I love you today, tomorrow, and forever.
Once again,  
HAPPY BIRTHDAY DADDY ❤️  
I LOVE YOU SOOOOO MUCH 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
